## Global Setup

In the `Tools` > `Global Options` > `General` Tab,
you want to uncheck the boxes that open previous files and projects,
and also make sure that no `.RData` is saved when you quit RStudio,
and to never save the `.RData`
(this prevents RStudio from loading up previous data when you open it,
it does not refer to its ability to load and save data as you use it).

## LaTeX and XeLaTeX

In the `Sweave` option

change the `Sweave` option to `Knitr`,
and `pdflatex` to `xelatex`.




## Code snippets

As we started to type `for` above,
the code completion popped up
and the first entry said "snippet",
what is that?
A code snippet is a text macro,
which means that you can type a short string of characters
to insert a template or snippet of text by pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd>.
You can see all the default snippets
and define your own by going to
`Tools -> Global options -> Code -> Edit snippets`.
Snippets are available anywhere in RStudio,
not just in R Markdown documents.
