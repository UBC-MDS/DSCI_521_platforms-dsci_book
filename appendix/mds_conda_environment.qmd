title: MDS Conda Python Environment
---

The
[MDS Installation Guide](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/installation_instructions/)
has a section on the Python setup.
After you
[install miniforge3](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#miniforge3),
you can install the packages we had you install from the guide using.
In the installation guide,
we had you run this in the `base` conda environment.
By the end of this course, you should know how to create, activate, and install
these packages in a separate environment.

```bash
conda install python=3.11 pandas jupyterlab jupyterlab-git jupyterlab-spellchecker otter-grader
```

You can choose to manually curate an `environment.yml` file as such:

```yaml
name: mds-base
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - conda
  - python=3.12
  - pandas
  - jupyterlab
  - jupyterlab-git
  - jupyterlab-spellchecker
  - otter-grader
```

This is a great base reference file for all the classes you will need in MDS.
