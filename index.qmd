How to install, maintain, and use the data scientific software "stack". The Unix operating system, integrated development environments, and problem solving strategies.

## Course Learning Objectives

- Use the Unix command line to navigate their computer's filesystem.
- Define and distinguish between absolute file paths and relative file paths.
- Effectively use local and remote version control software
  (e.g., Git and GitHub) to organize projects and manage file versions.
- Create, edit and run reproducible literate Python and R code documents
  (e.g., reports and presentations) using Jupyter and RMarkdown.
- Write and edit Markdown and in-line LaTeX syntax within literate code documents.
- Define and correctly use a project working directory.
- Diagnose and troubleshoot programming and development environment problems,
  and explain how such problems can be avoided.
