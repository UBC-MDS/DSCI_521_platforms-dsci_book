## R environments

In R,
environments are managed by `renv`,
which works with similar principles as `conda`,
and other virtual environment managers,
but the commands are different.
To see which commands are used in `renv`,
you can [visit the project website](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).
Briefly,
`renv::init()` is used to create a new env,
`renv::snapshot` is used to save/export the environment to a file (`renv.lock`),
and installing and removing packages are done as usual
via the `install.packages()` and `remove.packages()` commands.
