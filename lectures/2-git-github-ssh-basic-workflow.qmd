## Introduction

In this lecture, you'll learn how to manage project changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain a complete project history using Git and GitHub. Let's get started!

## Why version control?

To **version control** a project, you need two main components: a version control system and a repository hosting service. *The version control system*, like Git, manages changes to the project, allowing you to share updates, receive contributions, and resolve conflicts. *A repository hosting service*, such as GitHub, stores your project online, facilitating remote access, collaboration, and distribution of your final product. While technically optional, using a hosting service offers significant advantages like access management, bug tracking, external contributions, and secure cloud backup. Given their benefits and the availability of free accounts, there are few reasons not to utilize a hosting service for your project.

## Setting Up and Remotely Accessing SSH Keys for Use with GitHub

Let's start with some definitions:

### Definitions

**Secure SHell (SSH) `ssh`** is a secure method commonly used for remotely logging into another computer. 

**The server** is the machine you are connecting to via SSH, which passively waits for incoming connections.

**The client** is usually your own machine, which initiates the contact with the server.

## What are some password-based authentication

Passwords are often short and relatively easy to guess or "break." For instance, consider a password with 12 characters, where each character can be one of 26 uppercase letters, 26 lowercase letters, 10 digits, or approximately 10 special characters. This results in around 70 possible choices per character, making the total number of possible combinations approximately $70^{12}\approx 10^{22}$. While this is an extraordinarily large number, patterns in password creation can make them more predictable and easier to guess. More detailed discussions on security and privacy will be covered in future courses.

## SSH key-based authentication

SSH key-based authentication involves two components: *a public key* and a *private key*. These keys have an asymmetrical relationship. *The public key* cannot decrypt messages that are encrypted using the *private key*. Conversely, the *private key* can decrypt messages that are encrypted using the *public key*. This setup ensures secure communication by allowing only the holder of the private key to access messages encrypted with the *public key*.

## Understanding public key private key concepts

Consider the public key not as a key but as a padlock. You can make copies of this padlock and place them wherever you like. To secure another machine with your padlock, you would copy it to the `authorized_keys` file in the `~/.ssh` folder on that machine. Conversely, think of the private key as an actual key, which is used to unlock the padlock stored on the other machine. This arrangement ensures secure access to the machine that holds the corresponding padlock.

## You can put your lock at many places

As long as you are using the same lock (public key),
you will be able to open it with the same private key.

![](img/keys_2.png)
*source: http://blakesmith.me/2010/02/08/understanding-public-key-private-key-concepts.html*

## How the lock works

SSH keys are generated using the `ssh-keygen` command, which creates a pair consisting of a private key (usually named `id_rsa`) and a public key (typically called `id_rsa.pub`). You can distribute copies of the public key, which acts like a padlock, to other machines. When you attempt to connect, the other machine encrypts a challenge message using your public key. To gain access, you must demonstrate that you can decrypt this message, thereby proving possession of the corresponding private key. This process ensures that the connection is both secure and authorized.

## Why SSH keys over passwords

SSH keys use the [RSA cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))

The private key is much longer than a password. A standard now is 4096-bit keys, which means $> 10^{1200}$ possibilities. This makes it harder for a hacker to break (guess) the password. More on this when we discuss binary numbers next week.

Aside: Quantum computers will be able to break RSA encryption. It is very hard to predict whether this is years or decades away.

## Keeping your private key safe

The `ssh-keygen` command allows you to add a layer of security to your private key by setting a password or passphrase. 

It's crucial that this passphrase remains confidential and not shared with anyone. 

If your private key were to fall into the wrong hands, the passphrase would still be required to use it, providing an additional level of security.

## Different type of keys

There may be different methods of how to generate private-public key pairs.

The [GitHub SSH key generation instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) uses the `-t` flag to indicate the "type" of key to create,
in thier instructions they use the `ed25519` algorithm to create private and public values.

The general premice to SSH keys is the same, there is a private key that stays on your machine and is never shared with other people,
and the public key you can freely share that will be used to authenticate the machine with the private key on it.

### Authentication vs. encryption

The system described above focuses solely on authentication. In this process, the client must demonstrate to the server that it is authorized to access the server. This is established when someone with the necessary authority adds the client's public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server. Once this is done, the server will grant access to anyone who possesses a private key that matches one of the public keys listed.

This authentication process is distinct from the encryption of data transmitted between the client and server. Encryption ensures that the communication between the client and server remains confidential, preventing any potential eavesdroppers from intercepting or listening to the exchange.

## What is a Git repository?

A Git repository stores all the necessary information
for version control your project in a hidden folder called `.git`.
If you want to know if you are working in a Git repo using the terminal
you can use the bash command `ls -a` as you can see in the image.
The `-a` flag will include into the lists of files
displayed on the terminal the hidden folders.
If `.git` is included you are working in a Git repository.

By cloning a repository from GitHub to your computer,
you are automatically getting a copy of `.git` and thus, working on a Git.

## Creating a Repository

## Lecture 2 Activity 1

::::{.activity-container}
We can create a repository one of two ways:

1. Start on GitHub and **then** clone the repository to your local computer using Git.
2. Start in a folder on your local computer, use Git to initialize it as a Git repository (by typing `git init` inside the directory). **Then** create a new repository on GitHub without adding any files. **Then** use Git to tell your local computer where the remote is (i.e., the location of the empty GitHub repository on GitHub).

You can see the second method requires more work. So the first method is usually the most convenient and it is sufficient for you to only use this approach.

## Cloning repositories from GitHub

If you only need to make minor edits, you can directly edit files on GitHub using their online editor, eliminating the need to clone the repository. 

However, if you intend to run the code on your own machine and make modifications there, you will need to clone the repository to facilitate these changes.

To clone a repository, follow these steps! 

    Step 1: start by navigating to the specific repository on GitHub. 

    Step 2: Click the green "Clone or download" button, ensuring the pop-up indicates "Clone with HTTPS" (we will cover SSH authentication later). 

    Step 3: Copy the provided URL to your clipboard. 

    Step 4: Next, open Bash on your laptop and navigate to the directory where you wish to clone the repository using the cd command. 

    Step 5: Type git clone followed by the URL, such as git clone https://github.com/github_username/repository_name.git, and press enter. 

    Step 6: After the download completes, you can use cd to enter the cloned directory and ls to verify that the contents match what you saw online.

For more details, see Github's docs on [cloning](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).

**Be Careful**: do not nest git repositoies. That is, there should not be one git repository inside another git repositoiry.
Be careful that when you are using `git clone` (or `git init`)


## Creating a repository from GitHub (method 1 above)

I recommend that you follow along with these steps on your own machine to practice the commands as you are reading about them.

If it is sometimes unclear where to click or what the output should look like from a command,
refer to the corresponding sections of the videos to see exactly what to do (The git workflow one and the ones from lecture 2).

You can create however many repositories on GitHub that you would like and remove them after,
so you don't need to worry about experimenting
and creating several new ones.

### Steps to follow:

    Step 1: Start by navigating to https://github.ubc.ca and ensure you are logged in.

    Step 2: Click the green "New repository" button. Alternatively, if you are on your profile page, select "Repositories" and then click the green "New" button.

    Step 3: Enter a name for your repository. Decide between making your repository public or private. Remember, a public repository is visible to everyone, though only you can push to it.

    Step 4: Check the box labeled "Initialize this repository with a README." This step allows the repository to be cloned immediately without needing to add a file manually later.

    Step 5: Click the big green "Create repository" button.

    Step 6: That's it! You now have a new repository on GitHub!

## Adding & committing changes to version controlled files

There are two ways to make changes to your files in the remote repo on GitHub:

The first approach involves editing files directly through GitHub's web interface. This method is streamlined as it bypasses the need to stage files, offering a convenient option for minor edits. It's especially suited for quick updates where the lack of staging flexibility isn't a concern.

Alternatively, if you prefer to work locally, you can modify files on your computer. This method involves a few more steps: first, you `add` the changes to the staging area, then `commit` them to your local repository, and finally `push` the updates back to GitHub.

To demonstrate the first method, let's edit the README.md file in your GitHub repository. Here are the steps to follow:

### Steps to follow:

    Step 1: Click on the README.md file link in your repository on GitHub.

    Step 2: Click on the pen tool located on the right-hand side of the document.

    Step 3: Add your name as the author to the document (e.g., "author: Roald Dahl").

    Step 4: Provide a commit message, such as "Add author info."

    Step 5: Click the big green button "Commit changes" to save your work. This action combines git add and git commit into one step.

    Step 6: Download the repository to your local computer by cloning it. Use the command git clone followed by the repository's URL.

## Changing and saving version controlled files

To make a change to a file inside a Git repository, start by editing it as you would any other local file. For example, you can use a text editor with a command like `code name-of-file.txt`.

Once you have made changes to a file in a local Git repository (such as on your laptop), you need to tell Git that you want to record these changes in the version history. This process involves two main steps: **adding** the changes to the staging area and then **committing** them. 

Committing saves the differences between the current and previous version of the file along with a message describing what you did. These changes are saved in the hidden .git directory within the Git repository.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to add and commit changes:

    Step 1: Add changes to the staging area:
    Use the command git add file-name(s) to move the changes to the staging area.

    Step 2: Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
    Use the command git commit -m "Clarify the README installation instructions" to commit the changes along with a message that describes what you did.`

For more details, see Software Carpentry's lesson on [tracking local changes with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/04-changes/).

### What is the staging area, and why is it there?

![](img/staging_area.png)

Once you reach a point that you want Git
to keep a record of the current version of your work,
you need to commit (i.e., snapshot) your changes.
A prerequisite to this is telling Git which files
should be included in that snapshot.
We call this step adding the files to the **staging area**.

Note that the staging area is not a real physical location on your computer;
 it is instead a conceptual placeholder for these files until they are committed.
 The benefit of the Git version control system using a staging area is
 that you can choose to commit changes in only certain files.
 For example, we add only the two files that are important
 to the analysis project (`analysis.ipynb` and `README.md`) and
  not our personal scratch notes for the project (`notes.txt`).

The staging area allows more control over what you are about to commit,
allowing you to commit parts of a file or multiple files together
with a single descriptive message.
To add parts of a file instead of everything type `git add -p`
and then interactively choose which parts you want by typing either `n` (no)
or `y` (yes) followed by pressing enter for each chunk of code.
This workflow is great for reviewing the changes as you add them
to the staging area,
which ensures you don't commit anything by mistake.
Note that you must omit`-p`
when adding new files,
so you would type `git add <filename>`.

**Commands**

To add all updated, new, and deleted files in the git repo you can type `git add --all`.
To only add all updated and new files in the git repo you can type `git add .`.
To only add all updated and deleted files in the git repo you can type `git add -u`,
this is very useful.

To see which files you have staged, before committing them,
you can use `git status`.
To see the exact changes you have staged instead of just the file names,
use `git diff --staged`.
Finally,
if you change your mind and want to removea file from the staging area,
you can type `git restore --staged name-of-your-file.txt`

## Commit your files

To include a description in your commit using the terminal,
you should write the command `git commit` and press ENTER.
After doing that, a file called `COMMIT_EDITMSG` will open in your editor.
There you can write the title and body of the commit message
that you want to associate with your changes.


## Push local changes to GitHub

Once you have committed, you changes are saved locally on your laptop.
To also upload them to GitHub, you need to "push" the changes to Github.
Since you cloned an online repository at the beginning,
git knowed that you want to push you changes to that location by default,
and you can do so by typing `git push` without specifyin a URL.

For more details, see Github's doc on [pushing changes to Github](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/).

**Always verify that your assignments were uploaded by viewing the online repo!**

## Pull your changes from a remote repository

Changes pushed by collaborators, or created directly on GitHub
will not be automatically sent to your local repository.

If you are working on a project with collaborators,
they will also be making changes to files (e.g., to the analysis code in a Jupyter notebook and the project’s `README` file),
committing them to their own local repository, and pushing their commits to the remote GitHub repository
to share them with you. When they push their changes, those changes will only initially exist
in the remote GitHub repository and not in your local repository.

To obtain the new changes from the remote repository on GitHub,
you will need to pull those changes to your own local repository.
By pulling changes, you synchronize your local repository to what is present on GitHub.
Additionally, until you pull changes from the remote repository, you will not be able
to push any more changes yourself (though you will still be able to work and make commits in your own local repository)

If you want to do this with the terminal,
you have to pull from the terminal you should use the command `git pull`.
